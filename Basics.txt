Let's begin with the blockchain basics!

I'll keep these notes as structured as possible, to make it easy to refer whenever in doubt!

->Bitcoin - peer-to-peer transanctions - decentralised networks - powered by cryptography - superior digital store of value

->Ethrerium - decentralised contracts in addition to decentralised transanctions- smart contracts - Essentially, Etherium = Bitcoin logic(Decentralised network) + agreements
Note: Smart contracts are just a set of instructions followed in a decentralised network.

->Bitcoin is turing incomplete - turing complete = a machine/program that can solve all the problems which the turing machine can (devloped by the OP Alan Turing)

->Blockchains face the Oracle Problem - Oracle Problem = Theory that humans are never sufficiently equipped with the data to test their programs (just like how unlike Oracles, we cannot predict our own future)- Blockchain technologies cannot really communicate with data out there in the world

->Blockchains are deterministic systems- everything happens in their own network (sort of mini-world)

->Blockchain Oracle: A device that provides the "off-link" data to a blockchain smart contract

->Hybrid smart contracts - on-chain + off-chain agreements - with the help of above mentioned oracles

->Chainlink - decentralised oracle network - brings both on-chain and off-chain data - decentralised 

->Dapp = Decentralised application = smart contract protocol

What do smart contracts do?
- They create "trust minimised agreements" - Unbreakable promises

To summarise till here, what exactly do blockchains bring to the table?
-> Decentralised
-> Immutable (Security)
-> Transparent
-> Efficient
-> Counterparty risk removal
